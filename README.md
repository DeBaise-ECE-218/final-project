The Nucleo F429ZI is based on the STM32 microcontroller. Currently, no good libraries exist to drive Neopixels on the Nucleo board. Thus, an external Arduino Micro was used to drive the Neopixels and interface with the Nucleo controller. The provided 'FinalProjectCode.ino' file should be uploaded to the Arduino in order to drive the Neopixels.
